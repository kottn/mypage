## Beautiful documentation

Material is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fast and flexible static site generator. It is built using Google's [material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
guidelines, fully responsive, optimized for touch and pointer devices as well
as all sorts of screen sizes.

Material is very lightweight â€“ it is built from scratch using Javascript and
CSS that weighs less than 30kb (minified, gzipped and excluding Google Fonts
and Analytics). Yet, it is highly customizable and degrades gracefully in older

## Quick start

Install with `git`:

```sh

## Acknowledgements

Last but not least a big thank you to [Martin Donath](https://github.com/squidfunk). He created the original [Material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) for Hugo's companion [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). This port wouldn't be possible without him.

Furthermore, thanks to [Steve Francia](https://gihub.com/spf13) for creating Hugo and the [awesome community](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/graphs/contributors) around the project.
