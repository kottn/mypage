# kottn.me

**kottn.me** is an aggregation of "Unknown X" in my brain for organize thinking myself. The X are categorized into several contents, e.g., [interest](/categories/interest/), [lifelog](/categories/lifelog/), [movie](categories/movie/), [music](/categories/music/), [book](/categories/book/), [research](/categories/research/), or [others](/categories/others/). You can also visit the list page of a single section in [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/).

Enjoy.
